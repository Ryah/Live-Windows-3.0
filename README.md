# LIVE WINDOWS 3.0

An AutoHotKey Script to monitor a window or section of a window (such as a progress bar, or video) in a resizable live preview window (thumbnail)									  

This is an update to the [Updated LiveWindows AHK script by KYF](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/71692-an-updated-livewindows-which-can-also-show-video/), which takes advantage of Windows Vista/7 aeropeak. 

The script relies on [Thumbnail.ahk by maul.esel](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/65854-aero-thumbnails/). 
It also takes advantage of [WinDrag.ahk by Nickstokes](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=57703).
